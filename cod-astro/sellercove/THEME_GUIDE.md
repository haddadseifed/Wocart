# SellerCove — Wocart theme implementation guide

SellerCove is an independent storefront theme based on Wocart's reference implementation. This guide preserves the platform contract and architecture rules that the SellerCove theme must follow. It is multi-language
(Arabic / French / English), RTL-first, conversion-focused, and neutral enough to
fit any store — beauty, electronics, supplements, home goods, general retail.

Read it as the answer to *"what does a correct Wocart theme look like?"* A new
theme starts from this one; the platform underneath never changes per theme.

> **Two SDKs, two jobs.** `@wocart/storefront` is how a theme talks to
> `cod-server` — the source of truth for products, prices, stock, orders,
> delivery and OTP. `@wocart/theme` is how a theme is *composed* from editable
> sections. Both are consumed **by package name**, never by a relative path.

└── middleware.ts                # PRG decision — thin binding over the SDK middleware
```

**Two seams — one file each.** This is the rule the whole theme rests on:

| Seam | The only file | What may cross it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform reads | `src/theme/sdk.ts` | `@wocart/storefront/server` |
| Image URLs | `src/theme/utils/images.ts` | `mediaImageUrl` / `pictureOf` at `config.media` |

Everything else renders what those two hand it. A component that calls the
platform itself is a regression.

### Platform surface — do not touch from the theme layer

```
@wocart/storefront          ← the SDK: reads, actions, proxies, image helpers
@wocart/theme               ← the composition contract + Astro renderer
src/theme/sdk.ts             ← the one platform read seam
src/theme/utils/images.ts    ← the media-domain image binding
src/middleware.ts            ← action redirect (SDK PRG decision)
src/pages/api/**             ← same-origin proxies (SDK bindings)
```

If you want to change one of these it is a **platform change** (an SDK release),
not a theme change — stop and ask. A missing capability is an SDK change in
`@wocart/storefront`, never a local re-implementation. Reference data is part of
that line too: `WILAYAS` / `communesForWilaya` come from `@wocart/storefront`,
there is no `src/theme/data/`, and the commune bundle is parity-checked against
the server's seed rows. Everything under `components/`, `catalog/`, `content/`,
`styles/` and the `src/pages/*` templates is yours.

---

## 2. The two hard rules

### 2.1 Never hardcode a visible string

Every string a shopper can read lives in the locale packs —
`src/theme/content/<lang>/<area>.ts`, one file per area, typed per area under
`src/theme/content/types/`. The one flat `StoreFrontContent` is composed in
`src/theme/content/types.ts`, assembled per locale by
`src/theme/content/<lang>/index.ts`, and resolved at request time by
`resolveContent()` (`src/theme/content/index.ts`) from the store's configured
language and that language's overrides (`StoreConfig.contentOverrides`). Components read it from the `content` prop.

Adding a label = add the key to the area's **type** in `content/types/`, fill it
in **all three** locales' area files, then read it in the component — never type
the literal in markup.

```astro
{/* ❌ NO */}
<button>Add to Cart</button>

{/* ✅ YES */}
<button>{content.formSubmit}</button>
```

Miss a locale and it fails twice: the per-area type annotation (a compile error)
and `content/__tests__/packs.test.ts` (the three-locale parity guard).

### 2.2 Never hardcode a color, radius, font, or spacing value

The theme's tokens live in two places:

- **Static tokens** in `src/theme/styles/global.css` `:root` (`--clr-surface`,
  `--clr-border`, `--clr-text`, `--clr-text-2`, `--safe-top`, `--safe-bottom`).
- **Merchant-overridable tokens** injected at request time by `BaseHead.astro`
  from `getStoreContext().config` (`--clr-primary`, `--clr-accent`, `--clr-bg`,
  `--font-body`) — these reflect the merchant's choice in the dashboard.

Components reference `var(--clr-primary)`, never `#7c3aed`. Same for radius
(`var(--radius-card)`, `var(--radius-input)`, `var(--radius-btn)`), shadows
(`var(--shadow-md)`, `var(--shadow-primary)`) and easings
(`var(--animate-spring)`).

```css
/* ❌ NO */
.btn { background: #7c3aed; border-radius: 12px; }

/* ✅ YES */
.btn { background: var(--clr-primary); border-radius: var(--radius-btn); }
```

This rule is what lets one theme render any merchant's brand —
purple-and-orange, green-and-red, blue-and-yellow — without re-skinning a
component.

### 2.3 The composition rules (the theme contract)

Home is *composed* through `@wocart/theme`, not hardcoded in the page:

1. **Definitions are code; instances are data.** A definition
   (`catalog/home/<type>.def.ts`) says what a section *can* be — its type, label,
   fields and `load`. The document (`pages/home.page.json`) says which sections
   exist and what they say.
2. **A section never reads the platform itself.** The catalog's keyed `load`
   declares the read; the page owns ONE `createReadCache()` per render, so N
   sections still cost one catalog + one categories request. A section calling
   `products.list()` is a regression (guard: `product-zero.test.ts`).
3. **Adapt components, never rewrite them for the contract.** A definition wraps
   the existing `.astro` file — the component works with or without it.
4. **Fixed chrome stays out of page data.** Header, footer and nav are the
   theme's shell, not composition.

Add a section = add `catalog/home/<type>.def.ts` + register it in `theme.ts`.

5. **The editor reads the manifest, never the theme.** `/wocart-theme.json`
   (prerendered from `theme.ts` by `themeManifestEndpoint`) carries every
   section, field, preset, setting and text pack. A field an editor can fill
   is declared once, in the definition, with the SDK's kinds: copy (`text`
   with a `contentKey`), links (`url`), counts (`number`), images (`image` —
   a media key, resolved with `mediaKeyUrl`), formatted text (`richtext` —
   rendered with `richTextToHtml` into `.rich-description`), repeatable items
   (`list`) and store picks (`menu`, `collection`, `product`, `category`).
   Select options carry their editor words in `optionLabels`.

6. **An editor previews drafts on the real storefront.** `/wocart-preview`
   renders the surface the SDK's `previewTarget` picks — the page the draft
   edits, for the resource its path names or the store's first of its kind —
   from the draft an editor sends, with each section marked for the editor
   and the SDK's bridge loaded. A section with browser behavior binds it with
   `bindEach` (`@wocart/theme/lifecycle`), which binds a re-rendered section
   once more and never twice. When the whole page is swapped, the bridge fires
   `astro:page-load`, so page behavior mounted with `onEachPage` mounts again,
   as after a soft navigation.

7. **A publish shows at once.** Pages are cached at the edge (route rules
   in `astro.config.mjs`); after a merchant publishes, the Cloud calls
   `/wocart-revalidate` and the theme drops every page tagged `"pages"`. A
   new cached route takes that tag too, or it shows the old publish until
   it expires.

---

## 3. Design system

### Palette

The merchant picks a `primaryColor` and `accentColor` in the dashboard. Defaults
read well before any customisation.

| Token           | Default           | Source                   | Usage                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `--clr-primary` | `#7c3aed`         | `BaseHead.astro` runtime | Brand color — buttons, badges, links       |
| `--clr-accent`  | `#f59e0b`         | `BaseHead.astro` runtime | Secondary highlight — sale stripes, hovers |
| `--clr-bg`      | `#f8f8f8`         | `BaseHead.astro` runtime | Page background                            |
| `--clr-surface` | `#ffffff`         | `:root` (static)         | Cards, input backgrounds                   |
| `--clr-border`  | `rgba(0,0,0,.06)` | `:root` (static)         | Hairlines                                  |
| `--clr-text`    | `#0f172a`         | `:root` (static)         | Body text, headings                        |
| `--clr-text-2`  | `#64748b`         | `:root` (static)         | Captions, secondary text                   |

> **Accessibility note** — `global.css` carries explicit guidance on safe
> `--clr-primary` values. Keep contrast ≥ 4.5:1 against white. See the comment
> block above `:root` in `global.css` for recommended hex values.

### Typography

- **Default:** `Cairo` (a strong AR + Latin sans, free Google Font), loaded with
  **Plus Jakarta Sans** as the Latin fallback, then system-ui.
- **Override:** a merchant may supply their own `fontFamily` / `fontUrl` via the
  store config; `BaseHead.astro` rewrites `--font-body` and the Google Fonts
  `<link>` accordingly.

The theme stays **single-font**. A separate display face would fight the
Arabic/Latin balance — use weight changes (400 / 600 / 800) for hierarchy.

### Radius — friendly, rounded

Soft, generous corners are this theme's signature.

- `--radius-card`  `1.25rem` (20px) — product cards, sections
- `--radius-input` `1rem`    (16px) — form fields, dropdowns
- `--radius-btn`   `1rem`    (16px) — buttons

Don't go below 12px or above 24px. Below feels cold; above feels cartoonish.

### Shadow

- `--shadow-sm`      `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.04)` — hairline lift
- `--shadow-md`      `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,.05)` — card resting state
- `--shadow-lg`      `0 12px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.08)` — modal, hover
- `--shadow-primary` `0 8px 24px color-mix(... primary 25%)` — CTAs glow with the
  merchant's brand color

### Motion

- `--animate-spring` — `cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.1)`. The signature
  easing: snappy with a tiny overshoot — feels app-y. Use for hover states,
  button press, modal open.

---

## 4. Layout decisions

### Languages first

The theme defaults to **Arabic** (`lang="ar"`, `dir="rtl"`). Components must work
bidirectionally:

- Use logical CSS properties — `padding-inline`, `margin-inline-start`,
  `inset-inline-start` — never `padding-left` / `padding-right`.
- Tailwind: prefer `ps-*` / `pe-*` / `start-*` / `end-*` over `pl-*` / `pr-*` /
  `left-*` / `right-*`.
- Direction-implying icons (back arrows, chevrons) flip when `dir="rtl"` — most
  do via `transform: scaleX(-1)` on the SVG, or `rotate-180` in the existing
  RTL-aware components.

### Mobile-first with bottom nav

The theme ships a **mobile bottom-tab navigation** (`MobileNav.astro`) — it feels
native on a phone. Keep it. On desktop it is hidden and the top header takes over.

### Pages

- **Home (`/`)** — hero, trust strip, featured / new arrivals, categories,
  footer. Sections live inside friendly rounded cards.
- **Listing (`/products`, `/category/[slug]`)** — 2-col grid on mobile, 3-col on
  tablet, 4-col on desktop. Cards are rounded with `--shadow-md`.
- **Product detail (`/products/[slug]`)** — gallery left (sticky on desktop,
  swipeable on mobile), info + form right. Order form is inline below the fold on
  mobile.
- **Thank you** — friendly confirmation with "what happens next" steps.

## 6. The platform boundary

```
@wocart/storefront          ← the SDK: reads, actions, proxies, image helpers
src/theme/sdk.ts             ← the one platform read seam
src/theme/utils/images.ts    ← the media-domain image binding
src/middleware.ts
src/content.config.ts
src/pages/api/**
```

The data layer is platform-owned. If you think you need to change something
there, that is a platform change, not a theme change. A missing capability is an
SDK change in `@wocart/storefront`, never a local re-implementation.

Reference data is part of that line: `WILAYAS` and `communesForWilaya` come from
`@wocart/storefront`, and there is no `src/theme/data/` to edit. The commune
bundle is parity-checked against the server's seed rows before every SDK release,
so a corrected commune is a platform change on both sides, never a theme-side
patch.

---

## 7. Copy notes

- Three locales must stay in sync: `content/ar/`, `content/en/`, `content/fr/`.
  A per-area type enforces shape exactness — adding a key to one locale's area
  file without the others fails the build, and `content/__tests__/packs.test.ts`
  fails on any drift.
- Default language is Arabic (`lang="ar"`). The English pack is written for store
  owners reviewing copy or for English-speaking Algerian customers — not for
  international stores.
- Currency: `DZD` / `دج` (`StoreConfig.currencySymbol`).
- Phone validation: 10 digits starting `05` / `06` / `07`. Validated by
  `@wocart/storefront` (the phone schema), never in the theme.

---

## 8. Briefing for a contributor (or an AI agent)

You are working on **SellerCove**, a dedicated storefront built on Wocart. Its job is to be
**broadly useful** — a starting point any store can ship, and the worked example
other themes copy. That rules out styling choices that only suit one niche.

### DO NOT TOUCH

```
@wocart/storefront           ← the SDK owns reads, actions, proxies, images
@wocart/theme                ← the composition contract + renderer
src/theme/sdk.ts              ← the one platform read seam
src/theme/utils/images.ts     ← the media-domain image binding
src/middleware.ts             ← action redirect (SDK PRG decision)
src/content.config.ts
src/pages/api/**              ← same-origin proxies
astro.config.mjs              ← exception: only edit `integrations` if needed
wrangler.jsonc                ← Worker name + bindings
package.json deps             ← only add a dep if absolutely required
```

If you want to change one of these, it is a platform change. Stop and ask.

### YOUR JURISDICTION

```
src/theme/**                   ← every component, every style
src/theme/catalog/             ← the composition catalog (add sections here)
src/theme/content/{ar,en,fr}/  ← one file per area; all three locales in sync
src/theme/styles/global.css    ← static tokens; refine but don't break the system
src/pages/index.astro
src/pages/products/index.astro
src/pages/products/[slug].astro
src/pages/category/[slug].astro
src/pages/thank-you.astro
```

### THE RULES (re-read every commit)

1. **No hardcoded user-facing string.** Add the key to the area type in
   `content/types/`, fill it in **all three** locales, read it in the component.
   Grep your diff for a visible literal — if a shopper can read it, it is a
   violation.
2. **No hardcoded color, radius, or font value.** Use `global.css` `:root` tokens
   and the runtime variables `BaseHead.astro` emits. If you need a token that
   doesn't exist, add it to `:root` first. The merchant's `primaryColor` /
   `accentColor` / `fontFamily` flow through `--clr-primary` / `--clr-accent` /
   `--font-body` — respect that, never override it.
3. **Compose, don't hardcode.** New home sections are `catalog/home/<type>.def.ts`
   + registered in `theme.ts`, never markup inline in the page (§2.3).

### DESIGN BAR — what "theme quality" means here

The theme is the **safe default**. Don't ship a hero that only looks good for one
niche, don't pick fonts without AR + Latin coverage, don't choose accent
treatments that depend on a specific brand color. Every visual decision must work
at a beauty store, an electronics store, a supplements store and a general retail
store.

**Reference quality bar:** Shopify's default themes (Dawn, Refresh, Studio) —
niche-neutral but premium because they nail typography hierarchy, whitespace,
spacing rhythm, contrast and motion.

**RTL is first-class.** Test every component in `lang="ar" dir="rtl"`. A design
that assumes Latin left-to-right order breaks for most users.

**Mobile is the primary surface.** Algerian e-commerce traffic is 80%+ mobile.
The bottom nav is part of the theme's identity — keep it.

---

## 9. Data contract — what each page receives

Pages fetch via `getStoreContext()` and, through the one seam
(`src/theme/sdk.ts`), `storefront.products.get(slug)` etc. Your job is to render
what they pass to your components. **Do not fetch inside presentational
components — pass props.** The one documented exception is a section's catalog
`load`, which is where reads are declared; the page owns the read cache.

Key shapes (from `@wocart/storefront` — types + zod schemas):

- `Product` has `id, name, description, descriptionFormat ("text" | "html"),
  descriptionPlain, price, compareAtPrice, images[], variants[], offers[],
  inventory, trackInventory, …` — see §10 for the two description fields.
- `ProductVariant` has `id, price, compareAtPrice, inventory, variations:
  Record<string, string>` (e.g. `{"Size": "M", "Color": "Red"}`).
- `Offer` has `discountType: "free" | "free_shipping", triggerQuantity,
  rewardQuantity, …`
- `StoreConfig` has `name, currency, currencySymbol, primaryColor, accentColor,
  lang, reviewsEnabled, …`
- `StoreFrontContent` (from `src/theme/content/types.ts`) — the resolved language
  pack every component receives as `content`.

---

## 10. Rich descriptions — render, never parse

A description arrives in one of two formats, and the format is part of the
payload:

- `descriptionFormat: "text"` (or absent — every product that predates rich
  descriptions) → render it as **escaped text**, exactly as before. Never as
  markup, whatever it contains.
- `descriptionFormat: "html"` → the platform already sanitised it at the write
  chokepoint. Render it with `set:html` and do **not** re-sanitise, re-parse or
  escape it.

That trust is the contract: sanitising happens once, on the write path, in the
platform (`cod-shared/lib/rich-text.ts`) — so this theme, which is swappable and
imports nothing from the platform, never parses HTML. For `<meta>` and JSON-LD use
the product's `descriptionPlain` (tags stripped, entities decoded); the SDK's
`productMeta` and `productStructuredData` already do.

`src/theme/components/product/ProductDescription.astro` is the one place that
branch lives. Every tag the allow-list permits is styled under
`.rich-description` in `global.css`, and `rich-description.test.ts` fails when a
permitted tag has no style — add the style when the platform widens the list.

The allow-list (a mirror of `RICH_TEXT_TAGS` in `cod-shared/lib/rich-text.ts`; a
test compares the two, so keep the shape):

```
Text      p br hr strong b em i u s strike sub sup code pre
Headings  h2 h3 h4 h5 h6
Lists     ul ol li blockquote
Links     a
Media     img figure figcaption
Highlight mark
Tables    table thead tbody tfoot tr th td
```

Attributes are per tag, never global: `a` keeps `href`/`title` (`https`, `http`,
`mailto`, `tel` only — `rel` and `target` are forced by the platform), `img` keeps
`src`/`alt`/`width`/`height` (`src` must be `https:`), `td`/`th` keep
`colspan`/`rowspan`/`scope`/`headers`. Three features survive as attributes:
text alignment (an inline `text-align` on `p`/headings), the highlight colour
(`mark` with a hex or `rgb()` `background-color`), and checklists
(`ul[data-type="taskList"]` with `li[data-type="taskItem"]` + `data-checked`).
Every other `on*` handler, `style`, `class`, `id` and `data-*` is dropped, and
HTML comments are removed.

---

## 11. TECHNICAL GOTCHAS — already paid for in production

These are real bugs the theme shipped fixes for. Do not re-introduce them.

1. **Client-side navigation (`<ClientRouter />`) is on, page by page.** A page
   passes `softNavigation` to `StoreLayout`. Checkout and the thank-you page
   pass `false`, and so do product and landing pages when Turnstile is enabled:
   its widget renders once per document. Every POST form carries
   `data-astro-reload`, and so does every language link. An earlier version
   of the router was removed after `/_astro/*.js` chunks were served with an
   empty Content-Type; the release pipeline now sets and verifies the
   Content-Type of every asset. Changing this policy needs the owner's approval.

2. **Page scripts bind through `onEachPage`** (`@wocart/theme/lifecycle`).
   A soft navigation swaps the body without firing `DOMContentLoaded`, so a
   script that binds only there goes dead on the second page. `onEachPage` runs
   `boot` on the first load and after each navigation, and runs the teardown
   it returns before the old body is swapped out. An inline script that binds
   per page carries `data-astro-rerun`, or Astro skips it on a second visit.

3. **Dropdown visibility uses inline `display: none`, NOT a `.hidden` class.**
   Tailwind class ordering can leave `.hidden`-classed absolutely-positioned
   divs visible and click-trapping the form underneath. Reference:
   `src/theme/components/ui/Select.astro`. Carry the same pattern into any new
   dropdown / popover / drawer.

4. **No `transition:name=*` / `transition:persist` directives.** Same reason as
   #1.

5. **Don't add a `_headers` file in `public/`.** It doesn't apply to programmatic
   Worker deploys via the Cloudflare API path.

6. **D1 has no transactions in this codebase.** Sequential awaits only. (You
   shouldn't be touching DB code anyway — see §8 DO NOT TOUCH.)

7. **Browser scripts use Astro's native `<script src>` processing.**
   Browser scripts use Astro's native `<script src>` processing. Scripts are attached by the pages/components that require them (e.g. `<script src="../../theme/scripts/product.ts"></script>`). The page contract tests (`src/theme/__tests__/contracts/page-contracts.test.ts`) protect required page/script relationships (e.g. `track-abandonment.ts`, `turnstile-field.ts`). No custom script registry or `pageScripts()` abstraction is required.

## 12. Tailwind notes

- The project uses **Tailwind v4** via `@tailwindcss/vite` and
  `@import "tailwindcss"` at the top of `global.css`.
- The theme uses the `@theme {}` block to bridge Tailwind utility classes (e.g.
  `bg-primary`, `text-primary`) to runtime CSS variables. That's fine — the
  `@theme` mapping points at variables `:root` (or BaseHead's runtime block)
  defines.
- You may use Tailwind utilities for layout (`flex items-center gap-4`,
  `grid-cols-3`) and the `@theme`-bridged colors (`bg-primary`, `text-primary`).
  Do **not** use Tailwind raw colour utilities (`bg-purple-500`, `text-red-600`).
  Always go through the token.

## 13. Quality bar before you say "done"

A page is done when:

- ✅ `npm run validate:all` passes (no hardcoded visible strings, no hardcoded
  colors/radius/fonts/spacing).
- ✅ `npx astro check` reports **0 errors / 0 warnings**.
- ✅ `npm test` is green — including the boundary guards (`product-zero.test.ts`,
  `sdk-boundary.test.ts`) and the content parity guard (`packs.test.ts`).
- ✅ The page renders cleanly in `npm run dev` **and** `npm run build`.
- ✅ DevTools console is empty on a freshly-loaded product page.
- ✅ All clickable elements respond on first click; the gallery works on touch;
  the bottom nav active state updates on navigation.
- ✅ The page renders correctly in **all three** of `lang=ar/dir=rtl`,
  `lang=fr/dir=ltr`, `lang=en/dir=ltr`. Spot-check the order form, the gallery
  and the navigation.
- ✅ Lighthouse mobile on the PDP is ≥ 85 Performance and ≥ 95 Accessibility.
- ✅ This `THEME_GUIDE.md` reflects any new component you added — every component
  gets a one-line entry in §5.

## 14. Where to look when stuck

- **Need a component pattern?** The existing components cover most cases. Read
  first, mirror the style.
- **Need to know what an action returns?** Read `src/actions/index.ts` and the
  SDK's `PlaceOrderResult` (`@wocart/storefront/astro`).
- **Need an example of token usage?** `Header.astro`, `Footer.astro`,
  `OrderForm.astro` are token-clean. Match that style.
- **Need to add a composed section?** `src/theme/catalog/home/` — copy an
  existing `*.def.ts`, then register it in `theme.ts`.
- **Need the platform contract?** `USAGE.md` in the installed `@wocart/storefront` and its
  shipped types.

## 15. What "improving the theme" looks like

Good moves:

- Tighten typography rhythm and vertical spacing
- Add motion polish (more uses of `--animate-spring`)
- Improve the empty / error / loading states (often skipped)
- Improve PDP conversion (sticky CTA on mobile, trust strip below the buy button,
  scarcity / social proof when the data exists)
- Clean up token-violating inline styles you find while working
- Add a new composable section to the catalog (the documented way to extend Home)

Bad moves:

- Replacing the Cairo font with a Latin-only display face (breaks Arabic stores)
- Swapping rounded cards for sharp ones (that's a different theme's identity)
- Removing the bottom nav (it is this theme's identity)
- Adding a hero pattern that only works for one niche
- Hardcoding markup into `index.astro` instead of adding a catalog definition
- Reading the catalog inside a section instead of in its `load`

When in doubt, ask: *"Does this still work for a beauty store, an electronics
store, a supplements store and a general retail store, in three languages?"* If
the answer is no, it belongs in a different theme.
